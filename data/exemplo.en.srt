MATURE JENNY: My first
Christmas in Poplar was unlike
any other I had known.

11
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:52,933
The streets, like all streets,
were strung with
coloured lights,

12
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:57,633
and children drew up lists,
like children everywhere.

13
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,133
As the days ticked down,

14
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:02,533
it seemed as though
the district was fizzing
with delight.

15
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:06,167
But at Nonnatus House,

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,367
a different magic was at work.

17
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:18,333
The sisters spent Advent
in prayer and meditation.

18
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:21,333
And the atmosphere was not
one of excitement,

19
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:25,067
but of expectant, joyous calm.

20
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,967
I wasn't entirely sure
what I should make of it.

21
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,733
I was young, and faith was
still a mystery to me.

down the hospital. She's
already crying her eyes out.

-First one, she was in
labour for three days.

29

I'll come out and assess her.
Keep her tucked up
and warm till I get there.

It's all right. Come here.

Mrs Levons was very anxious
at the last appointment.

33
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,867
I'll come with you
to reassure her,

34
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,300
and then go on to
the mastitis case.

35
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,500
Oh, straw for the crib.
Well done, Sister Monica Joan.

stand right back so

were dispersed elsewhere.

This is a communal toilet,
and I was in the queue.
