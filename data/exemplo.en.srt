He's made his
opinion of my cooking
rather clear.

339
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,967
Fish and chips
for us tonight, I reckon.

340
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,933
Sorry, Doctor,
there's been a message
from the surgery.

341
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,067
Urgent home visit requested.

342
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,567
Lady called Mrs Jenkins.

343
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,067
I'm meant to be
at a rehearsal now.

344
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,100
Stay there and
don't talk to anyone.

345
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,233
You'll make me late.

346
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,167
Like you're always late.

347
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:29,767
Hello?

348
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,067

349
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:35,700
Mrs Jenkins?

350
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,133
I'm a doctor. Here to help.
